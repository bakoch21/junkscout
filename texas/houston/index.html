          Looking for a <strong>dump</strong>, <strong>landfill</strong>, <strong>transfer station</strong>, or
          <strong>recycling drop-off</strong> near <span id="cityNameInline">this city</span>?
          JunkScout lists nearby disposal and drop-off locations with hours, rules, and accepted materials when available.
        </p>

        <h2 id="faqDumpWhere">Where can I dump trash in this city?</h2>
        <p>
          Most areas have a mix of public drop-off centers, private landfills, and transfer stations.
          The right choice depends on what you’re hauling—furniture, household trash, construction debris, brush, or recyclables.
          Use the listings above to confirm what’s accepted before you drive out.
        </p>

        <h2 id="faqDumpFree">Is dumping free in this city?</h2>
        <p id="faqDumpFreeBody">
          Some public facilities offer free or discounted drop-off for residents with proof of address, while private landfills and
          transfer stations typically charge by load size, weight, or material type. Always confirm rules and fees before visiting.
        </p>

        <h2>What items are typically accepted?</h2>
        <p>
          Commonly accepted items include <strong>furniture</strong>, <strong>yard waste</strong>, <strong>brush</strong>,
          <strong>construction debris</strong> (C&amp;D), appliances (sometimes restricted), and mixed recyclables.
          Some facilities accept only certain materials or require loads to be separated.
        </p>

        <h2>Fees, hours, and resident requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Disposal rules vary by site. Some facilities are <strong>resident-only</strong> and require ID or proof of address.
          Others charge based on load size, weight, or material type.
          Hours can change seasonally—always check the facility’s website or call ahead when possible.
